# README:

Globetrotter is a simple travel application built on Rails. Users can sign up, log in, add locations, and post to locations ***when*** logged in. 

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.4.1

* Technologies used: Rails, bootswatch, devise, cancancan, & PSQL

## HOW IT WORKS:

* Navigate to the application homepage.

* Click on 'Sign Up' in order to edit, add, and view cities.

* Once logged in, you will be redirected to the cities page where you can add a new city of your choosing; or view, edit, & post to any city that already exists. 

* Each of the you create post will also show up in your own personal profile page for the application.

* Users can ***not*** delete other users posts on city. 

* Each post has the user ID of the user who created the post.
